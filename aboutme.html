            I’m one of many individuals who says “I’m from Chicago” when others
            ask where I’m from. When in reality I’m from Lake Zurich, a small
            Northwest Suburb of Chicago, but it’s all basically Chicago, right?
            If we want to get even more specific, I am originally from Poland.
            And before you ask: <em>tak, umiem mówić po polsku</em> (I think you
            can guess what that means).

            I grew up in Lake Zurich for most of my life, then went on to attend
            the University of Kentucky where I studied Chemistry. For one
            semester. Then made the right decision and transitioned to
            Advertising and Graphic Design. I ended up graduating with my
            Bachelor of Arts in Integrated Strategic Communication, which in
            laymen’s terms is Marketing and Advertising put together.

            In my free time you will find me at the barn taking care of the
            larger equivalent to dogs; horses. They have been my obsession since
            childhood. Any chance I get I will try to slip the topic of horses
            into a conversation. I also enjoy staring at strangers’ dogs on the
            street hoping they will want me to pet them, while also smothering
            my own dog with hugs and kisses. And I am an avid wine and beer
            “taster”, and inhale cheeseburgers and pizza like oxygen.
